        <h1>What is RAM?</h1>
        <p>RAM stands for Random Access Memory.
            It is the short-term memory of a computer, where data is stored temporarily while the computer is running.
            Think of RAM like a whiteboard in a classroom — you can write on it quickly, erase it, and write again, but
            once
            you wipe it, it’s gone.</p>

        <h2>Types of RAM</h2>
        <h3>DRAM (Dynamic RAM)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Needs to be refreshed many times per second.</li>
            <li>Slower but cheaper.</li>
            <li>Like a chalkboard — you can write, but you need to keep re-writing before it fades.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Sub-types of DRAM</li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h4>SDRAM (Synchronous DRAM)</h4>
                <p>Works in sync with the computer’s clock speed.</p>
                <p>Example: Like walking in step with your friend — both move together in rhythm.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h4>DDR SDRAM (Double Data Rate SDRAM)</h4>
                <p>Transfers data twice per clock cycle.</p>
                <p>Example: Like carrying two shopping bags instead of one per trip.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h4>DDR2, DDR3, DDR4, DDR5</h4>
                <p>Each new generation is faster and uses less power.</p>
                <p>Example: Upgrading from a bicycle to a motorcycle to a car — each is faster and more efficient.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>


        <h3>SRAM (Static RAM)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Does not need frequent refreshing.</li>
            <li>Faster but more expensive.</li>
            <li>Like sticky notes — stays there until you remove it.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Why is RAM Important?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>More RAM = more programs open at the same time without slowing down.</li>
            <li>Example: Like having a bigger table to work on — you can keep more books open at once.</li>
        </ul>
